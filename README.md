#Information Access and Retrieval

###Project for the Information Access and Retrieval class, given at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

The goal of this assignment is to create a functioning [vector space model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space_model "Vector Space Model - Wikipedia") that can be applied in the field of information retrieval. This vector space model should be capable of retrieving and ranking HTML documents with respect to a given query and different similarity functions.

The proposed search queries are:

Q1 - What video game won Spike's best driving game award in 2006?
Q2 - What is the default combination of Kensington cables?
Q3 - Who won the first ACM Gerard Salton prize?

The HTML documents that will be ranked are:

- 2010-22-100.html
- 2010-42-103.html
- 2010-58-044.html
- 2010-76-088.html
- 2010-99-086.html
